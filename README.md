# e621 Python Downloader
 A simple python script to download e621 images with specified tags and image amounts - Works with new API
## Branches
 The dev branch is for development builds, which may be buggy or entirely broken. Use these if you want to help with bug fixing.
## Releases
 I have built the python files into an .exe to prevent confusion, just download, unzip and run!
 Note: There isnt a release for V5 because pyinstaller is kinda broken lol
